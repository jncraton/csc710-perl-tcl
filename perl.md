Perl was created by Larry Wall in 1987 in order to make report processing simpler. Perl is notable for the inclusion of one of the powerful early regular expression engines. Perl was one of the first languages to incorporate a web-based module repository (CPAN), allowing easy sharing of code and modules to handle many tasks. The languages has diverged into two similar languages. Perl 5 follows the older language design, while Perl 6 introduces many breaking changes.
